# Encryption and Decryption Tool

## Description

The **Encryption and Decryption Tool** is a simple command-line application built in C++ that allows users to encrypt and decrypt text using two basic cryptographic algorithms: **Caesar Cipher** and **XOR Cipher**.

### Features:
- **Encrypt** text using Caesar Cipher or XOR Cipher.
- **Decrypt** text using the corresponding algorithm.
- **Save** encrypted or decrypted text to a file.
- **Load** encrypted text from a file for decryption.

This tool is ideal for educational purposes to understand basic encryption techniques and file handling in C++. It provides an easy-to-use interface with a simple menu for text encryption, decryption, and file management.

The project is implemented using standard C++ features, making it easy to compile and run on any platform with a C++ compiler.
